## Folder Setup

You choose three folders inside the app:

1. **Reference Photos** — one clear front-facing photo per student, file name = student name
   ```
   reference/
     Ali.jpg
     Siti.png
     Kumar.jpeg
   ```

2. **Events Folder** — subfolders of mixed event photos
   ```
   events/
     Sports_Day/
     Concert/
     Field_Trip/
   ```

3. **Output Folder** — where sorted results are written

---

## Output Structure

```text
Output/
  Ali/
    Sports_Day__IMG_001.jpg
    Concert__IMG_045.jpg
  Siti/
    Sports_Day__IMG_001.jpg    ← same photo, Siti was also in it
    Field_Trip__IMG_023.jpg
  _unmatched/
    blurry_photo.jpg
    no_face_detected.jpg
  kindersort_log.txt
```

---

## Important Behaviour

- Face matching threshold is `0.55` (strict — minimises false positives)
- Photos are **copied**, not moved — originals are always safe
- Photos placed directly in the Events root (no subfolders) are also supported — the folder name is used as the event name
- If a reference photo has no detectable face, that student is skipped with a warning
- v1.1 uses higher-accuracy face recognition (CNN + multi-jitter) — sorting 500 photos typically takes **8–15 minutes** on a standard PC; the spinning timer shows progress so the app will not appear frozen
